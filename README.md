Getting Started
---------------
You can access the site [here](https://kelsey-danebook.herokuapp.com). 

Sign up on the front page and you will be taken to your timeline, where you can post status updates.

You can access and edit your profile by clicking on the 'Profile' link.

Go to the Photos link to see all the photos you've uploaded as well as a form to upload new ones. You can also visit a photo's page to set it as your profile photo and/or cover photo.

If you view another user's profile, you will see a link to either friend or defriend them, based on your current friendship status.

Enjoy!
